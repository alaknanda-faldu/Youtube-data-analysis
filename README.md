# Youtube-data-analysis
Abstract- Data analysis has become an essential component of any large firm for identifying current trends and data and developing corporate plans, planning, and marketing. However, the majority of the data created is large in size and in an unstructured manner. Traditional database systems
and techniques are incapable of analysing Big Data.We propose to perform Data Analysis of YouTube data. It analyses the data and delivers information
such as the top-rated videos in each category, the most-viewed videos, and a ratting summary. Furthermore, we may utilise this information to do binning on each category and identify popular video IDs
